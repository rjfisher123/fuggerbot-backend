## FuggerBot v2.0 – Autonomous Trading Engine

### ✅ 1. Approval-Optional Autonomous Execution
- **File:** `models/autonomous_execution.py`
- Wraps broker execution layer with safety-aware autonomous execution.
- Optional human approval; logs all executions with safety context.
- Blocks trades if safety checks fail (drift spike, coherence break, etc.).

### ✅ 2. Autonomous Portfolio Rotation
- **File:** `models/autonomous_portfolio.py`
- Uses `PortfolioConstructor` + `RebalancingEngine` for automatic rotation.
- Evaluates whether portfolio drift requires rebalancing.
- Produces trade plans (symbol, action, shares) based on target allocations.

### ✅ 3. Safety Constraints Engine
- **File:** `models/safety_constraints.py`
- Enforces hard rails:
  - Drift spike auto-halt
  - High-volatility auto-flat
  - Coherence break → stop new trades
  - Low confidence (FRS/meta model)
- Returns `all_clear` flag and recommended action.

### ✅ 4. Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts
- **File:** `models/monitoring.py`
- Records metrics, generates alerts, and produces summary reports.
- Plug into dashboard or external alerting (Slack/SMS) later.
- Tracks last 20 alerts and recent metric history.

### 🔗 How It Fits Together
1. **Forecast → FRS → Meta Reliability → Safety Constraints.**
2. **Autonomous Portfolio Manager** builds target allocations based on latest signals.
3. **Safety Engine** validates environment (drift, volatility, coherence, confidence).
4. **Autonomous Execution Engine** routes approved trades via broker adapters.
5. **Monitoring Dashboard** logs metrics & alerts for human oversight.

### 🛡️ Safety Rails
- Drift score >= 0.8 → halt trading.
- Volatility >= 35% → flatten positions.
- Coherence <= 0.5 → block new trades.
- FRS/meta reliability < 0.4 → wait for confirmation.

### ✅ Status
- All v2.0 autonomy components implemented.
- System can operate in semi-autonomous or fully autonomous mode with hard safety constraints and monitoring.
