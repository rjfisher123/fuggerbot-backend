## FuggerBot v1.9 - Reinforcement Layer / Meta-Agent

### ✅ 1. FuggerBot Reliability Meta-Model
- **File:** `models/meta_reliability_model.py`
- Learns from historical FRS, trust scores, volatility, drift, regimes, and outcomes.
- Uses logistic regression to predict whether FuggerBot is reliable right now.
- Automatically falls back to heuristic (FRS + trust + drift) before training.
- Outputs reliability probability, classification (high / medium / low), and `is_reliable` flag.
- Supports continuous learning: `add_record()` → `train()` → `predict_reliability()`.

### ✅ 2. Execution Timing LSTM/Transformer
- **File:** `models/timing_model.py`
- LSTM-based timing model predicts entry/exit probabilities based on recent signals.
- Features include FRS, trust score, volatility, drift, expected return, momentum.
- Provides entry/exit signals with confidence, plus "ENTER / EXIT / HOLD" recommendation.
- Ready for expansion to transformers; uses PyTorch for training/inference.

### ⚙️ Architecture
1. **Meta Reliability Model**
   - Records historical performance: `frs_score`, `trust_score`, `volatility`, `drift_score`, `regime`, `outcome`.
   - Trains logistic regression classifier when enough samples exist.
   - Predicts reliability probability for current conditions.

2. **Timing LSTM**
   - Processes sequences of recent features (default 32 timesteps).
   - Outputs entry/exit probabilities with sigmoid activation.
   - Designed for reinforcement loops: feed performance results back into training batches.

### 📦 Files Added
- `models/meta_reliability_model.py`
- `models/timing_model.py`

### ✅ Status
- Reinforcement Layer complete.
- FuggerBot now has a meta-agent that learns when it's trustworthy and how to time entries/exits.

Next: v2.0 - Autonomous Trading Engine (safety rails + real-time monitoring)
