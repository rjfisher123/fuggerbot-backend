feat: Research Report Hardening v0.7 - Sharpe Sanity, Evidence Gating, Proposal Capping

Implements three critical hardening upgrades for decision-grade research reports:

1. Sharpe Ratio Sanity & Disclosure
   - Excludes NaN/±inf Sharpe values from all statistics
   - Reports median, p10/p90 Sharpe ratios
   - Tracks invalid Sharpe count with disclosure
   - Adds Sharpe definition block in appendix (periodicity, annualization, risk-free rate assumptions)

2. Insight Evidence Gating
   - Strong insights require >=3 scenarios AND >=2 regime coverage
   - Single-scenario/high-confidence insights downgraded to PRELIMINARY
   - New grouping: "Strong Insights (Evidence-Qualified)" vs "Preliminary Insights (Insufficient Evidence)"
   - Clear evidence requirements displayed in report

3. Recommendation Proposal Cap + Grouping
   - Displays only top 3 experiments (by information gain)
   - Remaining proposals grouped in "Experiment Backlog (Deferred)"
   - Backlog entries grouped by type with deferral reasons

Invariants Preserved:
- No changes to Sharpe computation logic (reporting-only)
- No changes to insight generation (classification-only)
- No changes to proposal generation/ranking (rendering-only)
- Deterministic output maintained
- Append-only learning preserved

Files Modified:
- report_schema.py: Added InsightEvidenceStatus enum, extended PerformanceMetrics/ReportInsight
- report_generator.py: Added Sharpe filtering, evidence gating logic, metric definitions
- markdown_renderer.py: Enhanced Sharpe display, evidence-based insight grouping, proposal capping

Tested: All three upgrades verified with 36-scenario report.
