feat: Historonics Agent - Historical Research and Hypothesis Generation

Implements a read-only historical research agent that generates structured hypotheses
about what to study next, without modifying simulation logic, scoring, or parameters.

Components:
- historonics_schema.py: Pydantic models for hypotheses (Hypothesis, HistoricalAnalog, HistoronicsOutput)
- historonics_prompts.py: LLM safety-enforced prompt templates
- historonics_agent.py: Main agent with DeepSeek LLM integration via OpenRouter

Integration:
- Added to research_loop.py (Step 5: after memory update, before proposal generation)
- Optional integration in research reports (appendix_historonics_hypotheses)
- Markdown renderer supports "Historical Context & Hypothesis Generation" section

Safety Mechanisms:
- Prompt constraints: Explicit "research historian, not trader" role
- Output validation: Rejects numeric prescriptions, executable code, certainty claims
- Error handling: Graceful degradation, non-blocking, returns empty on failure

Invariants Preserved:
✅ Deterministic execution (outputs advisory only)
✅ Append-only learning (read-only, no mutation)
✅ Strict role separation (Simulator/Meta-evaluator unchanged)
✅ LLMs never authorities (cannot set params, rank strategies, influence returns)

The agent exists to steepen the learning curve through historical context,
not to shortcut it through optimization.
