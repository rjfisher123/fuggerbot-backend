## Recommended Experiments

### 1. Verify: Trust threshold >0.65 improves drawdown in volatil

**Type**: hypothesis_test  
**Expected Info Gain**: 0.65  
**Priority**: 6/10

Test to verify/refute the hypothesis: Trust threshold >0.65 improves drawdown in volatile regimes

**Reasoning**: High-confidence pattern (0.75) should be verified across regimes

**Based on insights**: 

### 2. High Trust Threshold Test

**Type**: parameter_sweep  
**Expected Info Gain**: 0.60  
**Priority**: 6/10

Test trust_threshold=0.85 to explore conservative parameter space

**Reasoning**: Current tests cover 0.55-0.75 range. High threshold may reveal tradeoffs between safety and opportunity.
