This suggests either consistently unfavorable conditions or systemic avoidance by prior risk managers. The absence of any approved trades makes performance metrics unreliable despite being 'within acceptable ranges'.

Historical performance data shows no completed approved trades for this symbol, meaning we lack evidence of successful execution under current conditions. The absence of historical precedent matching this scenario further increases uncertainty. While the projected return is substantial (38.5% upside), the combination of untested strategy in high volatility and no track record creates unacceptable capital risk.",

The forecast target ($5001.21) represents a 61.5% upside from current price ($3096.05), which is substantial but must be weighed against volatility risks. Historical performance shows only 2 approved trades out of 183 total opportunities, indicating extreme selectivity. Weighted win rate and regret rate are N/A due to lack of completed approved trades, creating significant uncertainty about actual performance in live conditions. No historical precedent exists for current conditions, eliminating comparative analysis. The combination of high volatility, untested strategy in live trades, and absence of historical precedent makes this exceptionally high-risk despite strong forecast signals.",

High volatility regime amplifies price swing risks, and the complete lack of performance data on approved trades means we have zero evidence this can succeed in practice.

Despite strong predictive metrics, the fund's ETH-USD trade history shows extremely low approval rate (15.5%) with no completed approved trades to validate strategy. Target represents 39.3% upside, which is unusually large for current volatility regime. Risk/reward profile appears skewed given absence of historical precedents in high volatility environments. Regret Rate cannot be calculated but low approval rate suggests systemic caution. Recommendation overrides predictive metrics due to operational history mismatch.",
